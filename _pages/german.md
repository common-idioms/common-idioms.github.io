# Spanish Resources üá™üá∏

Hey everyone, here's everything I've put together for Spanish. This page has the Anki decks I've created, plus a list of other tools and websites I've found genuinely useful in my own studies.

I hope this helps you on your path to fluency!

## üóÇÔ∏è Anki Decks

Here are the Anki decks I've built. I've split them into two types: decks focused on learning common, useful phrases, and decks for building a strong foundation of core vocabulary.

### üí¨ Phrase Decks

These are great for learning how to string words together and sound more natural in conversations.

*   **[Spanish Travel Essentials](link-to-spanish-travel-deck.apkg)** - All the key phrases you'd need for a trip, from ordering at a restaurant to asking for directions.
*   **[500 Common Conversational Phrases](link-to-spanish-phrases-deck.apkg)** - A deck designed to get you comfortable with the natural flow of spoken Spanish.

### üß† Vocabulary Decks

These are focused on building a strong foundation of individual words, usually with example sentences and audio links.

*   **[Top 2000 Spanish Words](link-to-top-2000-deck.apkg)** - Based on frequency lists, so you're learning the words you'll actually see and hear most often.
*   **[DELE A2 Vocabulary Builder](link-to-dele-a2-deck.apkg)** - A focused deck to help you master the vocabulary needed for the DELE A2 exam.
*   **[Spanish Nouns with Gender](link-to-spanish-nouns-deck.apkg)** - A simple but essential deck for memorizing if a noun is *el* or *la*.

## Other Helpful Tools & Links

Learning a language is more than just flashcards. Here are some other resources I use all the time.

### Grammar & Verbs

*   **[SpanishDict Conjugator](https://www.spanishdict.com/conjugation)** - My go-to for checking any verb conjugation. It's fast, accurate, and shows all tenses.
*   **[The Language Tutor on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf8XN5kNFkhd2_58Z2aV3wG_d33S23y2s)** - Dr. Danny Evans breaks down Spanish grammar in a super clear and simple way. His videos were a lifesaver for me when I was starting out.

### Listening Practice

*   **[Notes in Spanish](https://www.notesinspanish.com/)** - An amazing podcast that starts from absolute beginner and goes all the way to advanced. The conversations between Ben (English) and Marina (Spanish) are natural and engaging.
*   **[Espa√±ol con Juan](https://www.youtube.com/c/espanolconjuan)** - Juan uses simpler Spanish and a lot of gestures, making his videos perfect for intermediate learners who want to practice their listening comprehension.

### Dictionaries

*   **[WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/es/)** - Fantastic dictionary, especially for its forums where native speakers discuss tricky translations and nuances.
*   **[SpanishDict](https://www.spanishdict.com/)** - More than just a dictionary. It gives you three different translations, example sentences, and conjugations all in one place.

¬°Buen estudio!
