# Welcome! 

My name is Common Idioms, and I'm a language learner I'm also a bit of a tech nerd. A while back, I realized I could combine those two passions to make the learning process better for everyone.

## What I Do Here

In short: **I create high-quality language resources.**

But I don't do it the old-fashioned way. Instead, I write custom scripts and programs to handle the heavy lifting. I put in the **personal effort**â€”reviewing, refining, and organizing the material to make sure it's genuinely useful, accurate, and easy to use.

It's the best of both worlds: the speed and power of code, with a human touch to ensure quality.

## The Resources

Here are some of the things I've built. Feel free to use and share them!

My goal is to keep everything here free and accessible.

## Like my work?

These projects take a lot of time, coffee, and trial-and-error to create. If you find them valuable and want to help me dedicate more time to building new resources, you can support me here:
